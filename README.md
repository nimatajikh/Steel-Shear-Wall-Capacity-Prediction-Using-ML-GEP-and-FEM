This repository contains the source code, dataset, and simulation results used in the study: “Shear capacity assessment of perforated steel plate shear wall based on the combination of verified finite element analysis, machine learning, and gene expression programming”

# **Overview**

This research presents a hybrid framework combining finite element modeling (FEM) with machine learning (ML) to estimate the shear strength of perforated steel plate shear walls (SPSWs). The goal is to predict the shear capacity across a wide range of geometries and configurations, overcoming limitations of empirical formulas and time-consuming simulations.

Finite Element Modeling (FEM): Verified nonlinear analysis of SPSWs with various opening configurations.

Machine Learning Models: Trained using FEM-generated data to predict shear capacity, using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression.

Parameter Sensitivity: Evaluation of key geometric features affecting shear performance.

Results: Performance plots, SHAP analysis, and equation derivations.

# **Contents**

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for ML model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

Data: Dataset generated from validated FEM simulations

Models: Scripts and saved models for ML, and GEP.

Results: Performance plots, SHAP analysis, and equation derivations.
